![Supported Foundry Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strongpauly/fvtt-player-initiative/main/module.json)

Simple module to allow users to edit initiative for combatants that they own. Adds an input that will update the initiative in the combat tracker.

Will also display a dialog to each player with controllable combatants at the beginning of combat prompting them to enter their initiative values.
