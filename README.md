# Foundry Virtual Tabletop - Edit Player Initiative

Simple module to allow users to edit initiative for combatants that they own. Adds an input that will update the initiative in the combat tracker.

Will also display a dialog to each player with controllable combatants at the beginning of combat prompting them to enter their initiative values.
